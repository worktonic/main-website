It is aimed at handholding the students of Work Tonic in navigating their unique challenges during their employment. New recruits might face challenges in their new environment. It could range from being heard, time management, disagreeable coworkers, office bullies, office politics, adjusting to the culture of their company, lack of appreciation or attention, lack of product training etc. Mentoring is a useful platform where the ex-students discuss their challenges with their mentors and find solutions to manage the challenges. It also serves as a monthly forum to brainstorm various issues they face and seek right advice from peers. This service is offered free for the first 3 months of their employment.</p>
